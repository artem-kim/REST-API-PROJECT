In this project I used Python Flask along with SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow to practise creating a RESTful API for products.

The app has no frontend, so I used Postman to test the APIs.

#### I created the following endpoints:

* GET /product
* GET /product/:id
* POST /product
* PUT /product/:id
* DELETE /product/:id
